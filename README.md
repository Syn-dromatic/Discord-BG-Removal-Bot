## Bot Configuration
Before running the bot you must configure the neccessary variables in `/variables/variables_bot.py`
### Required Variables
- BOT_TOKEN — Retreived from Discord Developer Portal after creating a bot application
- COMMAND_PREFIX — The prefix is a single-character string used to invoke commands to the bot - i.e. "$"

### Optional Variables
- ACTIVITY_TEXT — For displaying the bot's activity status, such as *"Watching [Text]"*, can be left empty
- max_frames_animated — The bot will reject to process requested GIFs or WebPs that have more than the assigned frames count
- max_px_image — The bot will reject to process requested images (PNGs, JPEGs, and single-frame WebPs) that are above the assigned pixel count in width or height
- max_px_animated — Same as max_px_image, but it instead applies to animated images (GIFs and multi-frame WebPs)

Run `main_bot.py` to start the bot.
